This script constructs(as best it can) the data structure for the CustomerPreview
pane in the MainWindow of the Chronicle client. This data structure  is built
according to the documentation found in `file:///chronicle/docs/build/html/preview_data_cart.html`
The data that is used to build this data structure comes from a mongo collection:
`mongo.orders.mysql_web_orders2`. This structure outline is detailed in: 
`file:///it/Development/projects/python/order_manage/OrderManageApplication/search/order_structure.py`
